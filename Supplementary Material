Supplementary A: Performance-Metric Findings [Continued]
A.1. Model Predictive Performance for 1-Month SPEI
In Table S1, GBM and XG again clearly emerge as the best-performing models. These two methods reduce average RMSE to the 0.03–0.04 band and MAE to 0.026–0.029, while yielding average R² values of 0.997–0.999, i.e., near-perfect outcomes. The very high inter-station consistency indicates that these boosting-based approaches are highly reliable for short-horizon (1-month) SPEI forecasts.
The LSTM method delivers strong performance with average RMSE ≈ 0.179, MAE ≈ 0.137, and R² ≈ 0.964. At certain stations, R² rises to ~0.99. Nonetheless, the decline of R² to ~0.91 at the weakest stations shows that LSTM is less stable than the boosting methods for short-term SPEI, while still tracking the overall tendencies quite well.
The SVR method attains results close to LSTM, with average RMSE ≈ 0.151, MAE ≈ 0.140, and R² ≈ 0.964. Although R² falls to ~0.87 at some stations, overall the results are consistent. While SVR can capture nonlinear relationships via kernel functions, hyperparameter sensitivity leads to inter-station performance fluctuations.
RF, in this study, is the lowest-performing method. With average RMSE ≈ 0.279, MAE ≈ 0.171, and R² ≈ 0.913, RF attains only limited success for short-horizon (1-month) SPEI forecasts. In particular, the drop of R² to ~0.82 at some stations indicates that this method remains weaker than boosting-based approaches.
Overall, for 1-month SPEI forecasting across Greece, boosting-based methods (GBM and XG) clearly stand out as the strongest models. LSTM and SVR form a second, yet strong, tier, performing well—especially in capturing nonlinear relationships. RF, by contrast, is better regarded as a supporting or benchmarking model due to its lower accuracy. In sum, for short-term SPEI, the most reliable and lowest-error models with the highest inter-station consistency are GBM and XG, while LSTM and SVR provide secondary but robust alternatives.

A.2. Model Predictive Performance for 6-Month SPEI
According to Table S2, a clear performance gap is observed among the machine-learning methods. GBM and XG stand out, delivering near-error-free forecasts with average RMSE ≈ 0.005, MAE ≈ 0.003, and R² ≈ 1.000. The extremely high consistency across stations indicates that these two boosting-based methods provide very strong reliability and generalizability for 6-month SPEI predictions.
The LSTM method exhibits very strong performance, with average RMSE ≈ 0.089, MAE ≈ 0.066, and R² ≈ 0.991. At some stations, R² reaches ~0.998, and even the lowest values remain around ~0.965, demonstrating robust generalization. However, the higher error rates relative to the boosting methods suggest that, at this horizon, LSTM is more limited in capturing short-term fluctuations.
SVR trails LSTM but still yields satisfactory results overall, with average RMSE ≈ 0.170, MAE ≈ 0.150, and R² ≈ 0.967. That said, R² drops to ~0.885 at certain stations, indicating pronounced sensitivity to parameter choices and greater inter-station variability.
RF records the lowest performance among the methods. With average RMSE ≈ 0.220, MAE ≈ 0.127, and R² ≈ 0.949, it produces weaker outcomes than the other models; in some stations, R² declines to ~0.889, showing that RF cannot capture the complex relationships in 6-month SPEI series as effectively as the boosting approaches.
Overall, for 6-month SPEI forecasting, GBM and XG are the strongest and most reliable methods. Their low error values and high R² make them the most suitable candidates for operational use. Leveraging its long-memory architecture, LSTM emerges as a strong alternative; SVR is moderately successful but more variable across stations. RF is best viewed as a comparative/benchmark method, given its comparatively limited predictive performance. In sum, the superiority of boosting-based methods is once again clearly evident for 6-month SPEI forecasts.
Table S2. Performance metrics for 6-month SPEI machine-learning results at stations in Greece
 
 A.3. Model Predictive Performance for 12-Month SPEI
According to Table S3, GBM and XG once again stand out as the clearly best-performing models. These two boosting-based approaches reduce average RMSE to 0.002–0.005 and MAE to 0.002–0.003, while driving R² to ~1.000 at nearly all stations. The combination of very low errors and high inter-station consistency makes GBM and XG the most reliable methods operationally for 12-month SPEI forecasts.
The LSTM method delivers very strong performance with average RMSE ≈ 0.070, MAE ≈ 0.053, and R² ≈ 0.994. At many stations, R² exceeds 0.995, and even the lowest values remain around 0.981, indicating that LSTM is a strong model for long-horizon SPEI. However, compared with the boosting methods, its higher error rates show that LSTM does not capture fluctuations at this scale as perfectly as GBM/XG.
SVR ranks third, with average RMSE ≈ 0.206, MAE ≈ 0.189, and R² ≈ 0.945. At some stations, R² drops to ~0.86, indicating weakened predictive power in certain areas. Sensitivity to kernel choice and parameter settings emerges as the primary reason for inter-station performance differences in SVR.
RF shows the lowest performance. With average RMSE ≈ 0.192, MAE ≈ 0.121, and R² ≈ 0.953, RF can track general tendencies but remains noticeably weaker than the boosting methods and LSTM. Moreover, inter-station variability further reduces RF’s consistency.
Overall, for 12-month SPEI prediction, GBM and XG are the most powerful and reliable methods. LSTM provides a very strong alternative just behind these two, whereas SVR and RF remain supporting models due to their lower accuracy. The results clearly demonstrate the superiority of boosting-based methods in long-term SPEI forecasting and indicate that, thanks to their stability across stations and high accuracy, these models should be the primary choice for both operational and academic applications.
Table S3. Performance metrics for 12-month SPEI machine-learning results at stations in Greece

A.4. Model Predictive Performance for 1-Month RDI
According to Table S4, clear differences are observed among the machine-learning methods. First, at several stations—Ierapetra, Milos, Naxos, Rhodos, among others—LSTM, GBM, SVR, and XG exhibit extremely large error values in the RMSE and MAE metrics. This indicates that, at those stations, these methods can yield unstable results due to overfitting, data scaling, or computational issues. Nevertheless, when the overall averages are considered, a clear performance ranking still emerges.
Excluding the stations noted above, GBM and XG generally deliver the best results. At most stations, R² reaches 1.000, with a decline to about 0.85 only at Souda. This finding suggests that boosting-based methods exhibit strong stability for 1-month RDI forecasts, but that data-related imbalances at specific stations can depress performance.
LSTM attains extremely high average values—RMSE ≈ 1.09×1033 and MAE ≈ 9.83×1032—producing serious model instabilities at some stations. However, where errors remain within normal ranges, R² rises to ~0.99, indicating that, although LSTM is theoretically powerful, it fails to deliver stable outcomes on short-horizon (1-month) RDI due to parameter sensitivity.
SVR likewise produces anomalously large errors (around 1036) at certain stations. With average RMSE ≈ 1.67×1035 and MAE ≈ 1.67×1035, the model fails particularly at noisy and variable stations. Even so, at stations with more regular behavior, R² remains in the 0.90–0.99 range, showing that SVR can yield strong results under specific conditions, albeit inconsistently for 1-month RDI.
RF is more stable overall, with average RMSE ≈ 0.38, MAE ≈ 0.30, and R² ≈ 0.71. While RF does not generate the extreme outliers seen in other methods, it lags well behind boosting approaches in accuracy. In short-term RDI prediction, RF fails to adequately capture complex inter-station relationships, with R² often remaining in the 0.60–0.75 band across many stations.
In summary, for 1-month RDI forecasts in Greece, GBM and XG are the most successful and reliable methods. Although LSTM and SVR can achieve high accuracy at some stations, they are not dependable due to serious instabilities. RF is more consistent but operates with lower accuracy. Overall, the superiority of boosting-based methods is reaffirmed; however, from the standpoint of model stability, data preprocessing, station-specific parameter optimization, and error-balancing strategies are critical.
Table S4. Performance metrics for 1-month RDI machine-learning results at stations in Greece

A.5. Model Predictive Performance for 6-Month RDI
According to Table S5, a clear performance gap again emerges among the machine-learning methods. GBM and XG produce the lowest error rates—average RMSE ≈ 0.006–0.008, MAE ≈ 0.001–0.004—and attain R² ≈ 1.000. In particular, XG delivers near-error-free results across virtually all stations, keeping R² close to 1.000, which makes it the most reliable model for 6-month RDI forecasts. GBM shows similarly consistent performance, clearly underscoring the superiority of boosting-based methods.
The LSTM method performs well with average RMSE ≈ 0.168, MAE ≈ 0.092, and R² ≈ 0.957. At some stations, R² climbs to ~0.99, while the lowest values fall to ~0.885. This indicates that LSTM generally captures long-term tendencies effectively, albeit with some inter-station variability. Even so, LSTM remains a strong alternative following the boosting methods.
SVR exhibits moderate performance—average RMSE ≈ 0.276, MAE ≈ 0.220, and R² ≈ 0.908. Although it achieves strong results at certain stations, R² drops to ~0.78–0.82 at others, signaling lower stability across stations. Sensitivity to kernel choice and limitations in capturing short-term fluctuations likely drive these differences.
RF also shows lower performance, close to SVR: average RMSE ≈ 0.257, MAE ≈ 0.095, and R² ≈ 0.933. While RF can track general tendencies, the decline of R² to ~0.86 at some stations indicates that RF is less effective than boosting methods in modeling complex, long-duration dependencies for 6-month RDI.
Overall, for 6-month RDI forecasts, the boosting-based models (GBM and XG) are the most successful and reliable, delivering both low errors and high inter-station consistency. LSTM stands out as a strong alternative, whereas SVR and RF exhibit somewhat weaker performance.
Table S5. Performance metrics for 6-month RDI machine-learning results at stations in Greece
 
A.6. Model Predictive Performance for 12-Month RDI
According to Table S6, a clear performance ranking again emerges among the machine-learning methods. GBM and XG achieve the lowest error rates—average RMSE ≈ 0.003–0.014, MAE ≈ 0.001–0.006—and the highest explanatory power with R² ≈ 1.000. These two boosting-based models deliver near-error-free results at almost all stations and ensure top-level inter-station consistency. Accordingly, for 12-month RDI forecasts, GBM and XG are the most reliable and operationally applicable methods.
The LSTM method shows strong performance with average RMSE ≈ 0.149, MAE ≈ 0.060, and R² ≈ 0.962. While R² reaches 0.98–1.00 at many stations, it declines to ~0.87–0.90 at some. These results indicate that, thanks to its long-memory architecture, LSTM captures drought tendencies and seasonal patterns well, but exhibits greater inter-station variability than the boosting methods.
SVR performs more modestly, with average RMSE ≈ 0.302, MAE ≈ 0.227, and R² ≈ 0.898. Although it produces strong outcomes at certain stations, the fact that R² dips below 0.85 at many stations suggests that SVR is unstable and inconsistent for long-horizon RDI forecasting.
RF is generally more consistent than SVR but lags the boosting methods in accuracy. With average RMSE ≈ 0.156, MAE ≈ 0.035, and R² ≈ 0.972, RF can track overall tendencies, yet is less successful than GBM and XG for 12-month RDI prediction. Its broader error spread across stations further indicates difficulty in fully modeling long-duration dependencies.
Overall, for 12-month RDI forecasts, GBM and XG are the top-performing models. LSTM and RF follow as strong alternatives, whereas SVR remains the weakest due to its instability and lower accuracy. These results once again confirm the reliability of boosting-based methods for long-term drought forecasting, demonstrating that—especially for a more complex index like RDI—they are the most suitable choices for operational deployment.

Supplementary B: Machine-Learning Methods: Training, Test, and Future Forecasts of Drought Indices [Continued]
B.1. RF Training, Test, and Future Forecasts for 1-Month Drought Indices
Inspection of Figure S1 shows that, in the SPI and SPEI panels, the RF model captures short-term fluctuations quite successfully. There is strong agreement between the training and test segments, and RF correctly anticipates abrupt transitions between drought and wetness phases. In the forward projections, seasonal periodicity and repeating oscillations are clearly preserved, indicating that RF delivers stable performance for short-horizon drought forecasting.
For RDI, by contrast, the inherent sharper swings and sudden changes of the series are more prominent. Although the RF model sometimes struggles to reproduce these abrupt jumps exactly, it still provides reasonable estimates of overall tendencies and the frequency of drought and wetness periods. In the future projections, the forecasts tend to collapse into a narrower band due to RDI’s volatile nature, yet the general character of the drought cycles is retained.
Overall, at the Corfu station and at the 1-month scale, RF yields strong and reliable results for SPI and SPEI, while remaining partly limited in representing the more complex behavior of RDI. This suggests that RF is effective on short-term, regular patterns, but should be assessed more cautiously for series with high volatility.

B.2. RF Training, Test, and Future Forecasts for 6-Month Drought Indices
In the SPI and SPEI results, the model captures seasonal fluctuations and periodic drought–wetness cycles quite successfully (Figure S2). There is strong agreement with observations during the training and test periods, and predictive skill is especially notable in SPI at pronounced peaks and troughs. The forward projections preserve this regular periodicity, indicating that RF provides reliable performance for medium-term drought forecasting. For SPEI, despite the sharper oscillations arising from climatic water-balance computations, the model still captures periodicity; however, it is less successful in tracking changes at the peaks, producing a forecast series that tends to repeat itself.
For RDI, owing to the series’ sharper, block-like structure, RF’s predictive success is more limited relative to SPI and SPEI. Although the model captures the underlying trends during training and testing, its agreement is weaker at abrupt jumps. In the future projections, the pattern is characterized not by regular cycles but by sharp rises and drops; after a while, the series likewise settles into a repeating loop. Overall, at the Corfu station and at the 6-month scale, RF exhibits strong predictive power for SPI and SPEI, but shows more limited performance for indices such as RDI that display higher volatility and sudden shifts. This indicates that RF is effective for regular, periodic patterns, but should be evaluated with caution for high-volatility series.

B.3. RF Training, Test, and Future Forecasts for 12-Month Drought Indices
In the SPI and SPEI panels, long-term tendencies are captured successfully (Figure S3). During the training and test periods, the model represents major drought and wetness phases to a substantial degree; notably, in the post-2000 test segment, forecasts track observations closely. In the forward projections, however, SPI and SPEI typically oscillate within the −1 to +1 range with regular long-term cycles, indicating that RF is not fully consistent with observations when capturing broad-scale drought trends.
For RDI, the series’ sharp, block-like structure limits RF’s predictive power. Although overall tendencies are captured in training and testing, model agreement is weaker at abrupt jumps. In the future projections, RDI exhibits pronounced ups and downs with sharp fluctuations, and the predicted values repeat at certain intervals. This shows that RF performs more weakly on irregular series such as RDI. Overall, at the 12-month scale, RF yields reliable results for long-term SPI and SPEI forecasts, while achieving more limited success for RDI. Thus, RF is effective at capturing regular long-term climatic signals, but should be used with caution where sudden changes dominate.

B.4. GBM Training, Test, and Future Forecasts for 1-Month Drought Indices
In Figure S4, the model clearly captures short-term fluctuations and seasonal cycles in the SPI and SPEI results. During the training and test periods, agreement with observations is high, and the transitions between drought and wetness phases—particularly in SPI—are forecast correctly. The forward projections likewise preserve the regular oscillations, indicating that the model reflects short-term variability successfully. In the SPEI forecasts, the sharp changes stemming from climatic water-balance differences are largely captured by the model, demonstrating the strong predictive performance of GBM.
When the RDI results are examined, however, the model’s performance is more limited relative to SPI and SPEI. The more chaotic structure of RDI—characterized by sharper and abrupt shifts—challenges GBM’s predictive power: although the fluctuations are mostly tracked during training and testing, the future projections exhibit notable deviations and some tendencies to plateau. This indicates that GBM is effective for indices dominated by regular periodicity and short-term cycles, but should be evaluated more cautiously for high-volatility series such as RDI. Overall, at the Corfu station, GBM delivers successful and reliable forecasts for SPI and SPEI, while showing more limited predictive strength for RDI.

B.5. GBM Training, Test, and Future Forecasts for 6-Month Drought Indices
Examining the GBM forecasts for the Corfu station’s 6-month drought indices, the SPI and SPEI panels show that the model captures seasonal cycles and medium-term fluctuations robustly (Figure S5). During the training and test periods, agreement between observations and forecasts is high; notably, the peaks and troughs of drought and wetness phases are represented correctly. In the forward projections, the regular cycles persist, and the model anticipates drought severity to oscillate within the −2 to +2 range—in line with the observed behavior. This indicates that GBM has strong predictive power for SPI and SPEI, especially where periodic patterns are prominent.
Turning to RDI, the series’ sharp, block-like structure is also captured successfully by GBM. Although the overall tendencies are largely reproduced in training and testing, the model’s forecasts do not match observations one-to-one at the abrupt ups and downs in the test segment. The future projections likewise maintain irregular but pronounced fluctuations in the RDI values. In sum, GBM produces strong and reliable forecasts for 6-month SPI and SPEI at Corfu, while showing more limited predictive success for RDI due to its higher volatility. This suggests that GBM is effective for medium-term, regular climatic signals, but should be used with caution for series exhibiting complex and abrupt changes.

B.6. GBM Training, Test, and Future Forecasts for 12-Month Drought Indices
In Figure S6, the SPI and SPEI panels show that the model captures long-duration drought and wetness phases successfully. During the training and test periods, past multi-year dry and wet episodes are represented with high fidelity—most notably, forecasts align closely with observations in the post-2000 test segment. In the forward projections, both SPI and SPEI exhibit long-term oscillations generally within the −2 to +2 range, indicating that GBM can track broad-scale climatic signals and persistent drought cycles. However, in SPEI the long-range forecasts gradually flatten, approaching an almost constant trajectory, which suggests reduced variability capture at extended horizons.
For RDI, a different picture emerges. Owing to the series’ sharper, block-like structure, GBM does not reproduce all abrupt changes; instead, it displays a more stationary, stepwise forecasting pattern. In the test period, pronounced fluctuations are captured only to a limited extent, and in the future projections the model often pins drought values in the −1 to −2 range, with forecasts becoming periodically repetitive over longer spans.
Overall, at the 12-month scale, GBM forecasts long-term drought tendencies effectively for indices with regular, persistent climatic signals (e.g., SPI, and to a point SPEI), but offers more limited predictive strength for RDI, where abrupt variability dominates—warranting cautious interpretation of the latter.

B.7. SVR Training, Test, and Future Forecasts for 1-Month Drought Indices
Figure S7 presents training, test, and forward-forecast results for (a) SPI, (b) SPEI, and (c) RDI. In the SPI and SPEI panels, the model captures short-term fluctuations effectively. During the training and test periods, agreement with observations is high; notably, the onsets and terminations of dry and wet phases are represented correctly. In the forward projections, regular, repeating cycles emerge for SPI and SPEI, highlighting SVR’s forecasting capability on series with strong seasonal character—although the vibratory texture visible in the original data becomes smoothed in the future forecasts.
The RDI results are more complex. Owing to RDI’s sharp, high-frequency oscillations, the SVR model does not capture all abrupt changes; deviations are especially evident at extreme drought and wetness values. Even so, the overall tendencies are largely reproduced, indicating that the model retains some predictive power for RDI.
Overall, at the Corfu station, SVR performs quite well in representing short-term, periodic drought variability, but shows limited success on high-volatility indices—particularly RDI. This suggests that SVR is a strong method for short-horizon forecasts, yet may require additional modeling components to better handle extremes.

B.8. SVR Training, Test, and Future Forecasts for 6-Month Drought Indices
In Figure S8, the SPI and SPEI panels show that the model exhibits clear agreement with observations in capturing fluctuations during the training and test periods. For SPI, seasonal periodicity is represented successfully, preserving the cyclical structure of dry and wet phases. For SPEI, despite the series’ greater complexity due to the inclusion of temperature and evapotranspiration effects, the SVR model tracks the trends quite well in training and testing. However, in the forward forecasts, while SPI displays a regular and stable pattern, the SPEI projections gradually lose realism, presenting repeated, regular cycles confined to the −1.0 to −2.5 range as the horizon extends.
The picture is different for RDI: the series’ sharp oscillations and irregularity mean that, although SVR fits the training data well, it struggles to align with the test data. Unrealistic deviations are especially visible when modeling extreme drought (negative tails). In the future projections, the fluctuations become more pronounced, yet the forecasts drift toward a repetitive pattern that lacks consistency with observed behavior.
Overall, SVR demonstrates strong predictive capacity for 6-month SPI, but shows lower performance for RDI due to volatility and abrupt changes. This indicates that SVR is relatively effective for more regular, cyclical series, but should be used with caution for high-volatility indices.

B.9. SVR Training, Test, and Future Forecasts for 12-Month Drought Indices
Figure S9 presents the SVR model’s training, test, and forward forecasts for the 12-month drought indices (SPI, SPEI, RDI) at the Corfu station. In the SPI and SPEI panels, the model shows strong agreement with observations during training and testing, capturing most abrupt transitions between dry and wet phases. Notably, in the post-2000 test period, the forecasts track observed drought severities closely, indicating that SVR learns the long-horizon drought signal reasonably well. In the forward projections, however, both SPI and SPEI become markedly oscillatory and variable; the forecast series includes extreme values that exceed the historical bounds, which reduces realism at extended horizons.
For RDI, the model captures past values only to a limited extent, and the forward projection becomes inconsistent with observations—the series effectively collapses into a near-constant line, signaling predictive failure for this index.
Overall, SVR satisfactorily represents long-term, undulating drought patterns for SPI and SPEI, but proves inadequate for RDI in forward mode. These findings suggest that, for future drought-risk analyses at Corfu, SVR forecasts based on SPI/SPEI are more reliable, whereas RDI likely requires more sophisticated (e.g., deep-learning) approaches or enhanced preprocessing to handle its volatility and distributional quirks.

B.10. XG Training, Test, and Future Forecasts for 1-Month Drought Indices
Examining the XG forecasts for the Corfu station’s 1-month drought indices (Figure S10), the model captures strong seasonality in both SPI and SPEI. Agreement between training and test segments is pronounced; in SPI, the model tracks fluctuations well, and despite small deviations in the test set, it reproduces the overall tendency and peak values, indicating reliable short-term drought forecasts. SPEI projections likewise provide robust skill in reflecting the combined effects of precipitation and temperature.
The RDI results are more variable and irregular. While XG reflects the major dry and wet phases reasonably in both training and testing, the forward projections tend to collapse into a relatively narrow band and under-differentiate prolonged drought spells. This suggests that, although XG performs very well for short-horizon SPI and SPEI, its skill can be more limited for RDI, a more complex, water-balance-based index.

B.11. XG Training, Test, and Future Forecasts for 6-Month Drought Indices
In Figure S11, examining the XG model’s training, test, and forward forecasts for SPI, SPEI, and RDI shows that the model produces predictions very close to observations for SPI and SPEI. In both indices, the forecasts track the fluctuations during training and testing and, in particular, reproduce the transitions between dry and wet phases with high fidelity. With SPEI, the inclusion of temperature and evapotranspiration effects renders drought episodes more pronounced, and the forward projections exhibit a regular cyclicity—evidence that XG models short- to medium-term cyclical behavior strongly.
For RDI, while the forecasts capture the overall tendency, the abrupt spikes in drought severity seen in the test set are smoothed relative to observations, indicating lower sensitivity to sharp changes than in SPI/SPEI. The forward projections suggest that seasonal oscillations persist for SPI and SPEI, whereas RDI follows a more stationary, less variable course. Taken together, XG delivers strong performance for medium-horizon drought forecasting at Corfu, providing reliable predictions especially for SPI and SPEI.

B.12. XG Training, Test, and Future Forecasts for 12-Month Drought Indices
According to Figure S12, the model closely follows the observed values during the training and test periods, and it represents drought and wetness phases particularly well in the post-1980 test segment. The forward projections exhibit strong oscillations, frequently producing extreme drought and wetness events. This indicates that XG has a high capacity to learn seasonal variations in long-term climate data, and that its SPI and SPEI forecasts for the future behave consistently with the patterns seen in the observations.
For RDI (see the RDI panels), the model presents a different picture. While the observed values are generally captured during training, predictive accuracy declines in the test period, and the forward forecasts are characterized by abrupt jumps and irregular fluctuations. Overall, XG provides reliable predictions for 12-month SPI and SPEI, whereas for RDI it yields a more erratic outlook. This suggests that the model is strong for long-horizon drought and wetness forecasting, but its outputs should be interpreted with caution for indices like RDI that involve more complex water-balance components.
 
Supplementary C: Interpreting Future Drought Forecasts from Machine-Learning Methods Using Maps [Continued]
C.1. Forecasts of Observed and Future SPEI-1 Values 
SPEI, similar to SPI, measures drought severity but explicitly accounts for evapotranspiration; hence it can reflect short-term climatic imbalances more sensitively (Figure S13). In the observed NDSPI map (a), severe drought is evident across the northern and central regions, whereas the south and the islands—especially around Crete—exhibit a wetter structure. This pattern indicates that temperature-driven evapotranspiration exerts a stronger influence in the north during summer, while the south remains relatively more humid.
In the maps generated from the machine-learning models, the LSTM (b) model offers the closest approximation to observations, successfully representing northern drought and southern wetness. The RF (c) model forecasts drought across the north and west in a manner broadly consistent with observations. The GBM (d) model suggests that drought will intensify and shift toward the north and the islands, while wetness is expected to advance northward. The SVR (e) model proposes that both the level and distribution of drought will persist under current conditions, with the northern dry zone shifting partly westward. Finally, the XG (f) model closely mirrors the northern dryness and southern wetness and thus exhibits strong predictive performance, while additionally projecting that the islands will trend drier.

C.2. Forecasts of Observed and Future SPEI-6 Values 
Based on the observed NDSPI map from 6-month SPEI (Figure S14), moderate to severe drought dominates much of the country. Drought is particularly pronounced across the north, interior, and west, whereas a relatively wetter pattern appears in parts of the west and the south—most notably around Crete.
Model projections. The LSTM (b) model reproduces the overall pattern reasonably well. It anticipates intensifying drought progressing northward and concentration over some islands. The RF (c) model expands the dry areas, projecting a more widespread drought, including most islands and the south. Similarly, GBM (d) forecasts drought over all islands, while suggesting an expansion of the moist zone in the central belt. The SVR (e) model shifts and amplifies drought westward and over the islands, while indicating moistening in the north; this configuration exhibits lower agreement with the observed map. Finally, XG (f) projects intensification and expansion of drought across the north, moist conditions in central regions, and drying over the islands.

C.3. Forecasts of Observed and Future SPEI-12 Values 
12-month SPEI is a key metric for assessing long-term drought and moisture anomalies. In the observed NDSPI map (Figure S15), severe drought stands out across the north, central mainland, and parts of the islands, whereas northern–central belts and the west exhibit a wetter structure.
Model projections:
•	LSTM (b): Predicts a pattern almost the mirror image of observations—turning currently dry regions wet and currently wet regions markedly drier.
•	RF (c): Shows a very similar configuration to LSTM, additionally projecting wet conditions across all islands and, by reducing drought severity, deviates from the prevailing expectation.
•	GBM (d): Best aligns with the observed spatial distribution—capturing drought in western and central Greece and moist conditions in the north—yet overstates the increase in drought severity.
•	SVR (e): Closely resembles LSTM/RF in spatial distribution but forecasts severe drought.
•	XG (f): Produces a spatial pattern similar to all models except GBM, while predicting lower overall drought severity than the current situation.
Bottom line. For 12-month SPEI, GBM yields the closest spatial match to the observed configuration to the present configuration, whereas the other models generally imply a reversal of the current pattern and diverge on future severity.

C.4. Forecasts of Observed and Future RDI-1 Values 
RDI is an important indicator for short-term drought detection, providing critical information during agriculturally sensitive periods. In the observed map of Figure S16, pronounced drought appears across the north and southwest, while the southeast and the islands—notably Crete and its surroundings—exhibit a wetter structure.
Model-based projections:
•	LSTM (b): Shows very high agreement with the observed distribution, correctly reflecting northern dryness and southern wetness, and projects substantial increases in drought severity.
•	RF (c): Predicts drought in similar regions but anticipates a large reduction in severity.
•	GBM (d): Suggests that the central wet zone will expand northward, while southwestern drought will spread over a broader area; it also proposes a partial decrease in severity.
•	SVR (e): Forecasts strong intensification and spatial expansion of drought in the south, while maintaining wet conditions in the central belt.
•	XG (f): Produces a spatial extent close to GBM, but projects very low drought severities, diverging from realistic expectations.

C.5. Forecasts of Observed and Future RDI-6 Values
In the observed map (a), drought impacts are clearly evident across the southern and western regions, while the north and the area around Crete display a wetter pattern. This indicates that prolonged rainfall deficits are concentrated in the western and interior parts of the country (Figure S17).
Model projections:
•	LSTM (b): Reflects drought successfully and provides a balanced depiction by approximating the southern wet zones; however, it projects an unrealistically large reduction in drought severity, which undermines plausibility.
•	RF (c): Tends to concentrate dry areas in the central belt and likewise over-attenuates severity.
•	GBM (d): Preserves the overall pattern, forecasting that drought will expand northward over a broader area while maintaining its intensity, and represents moist zones in a balanced manner—yielding a credible outlook.
•	SVR (e): Diverges from the other models, projecting intensifying, concentrated drought over the central–western regions.
•	XG (f): Produces a pattern less aligned with the multi-model consensus in overall distribution, predicting that drought will shift almost entirely toward the north, thus producing a forecast pattern distinct from the other models.

C.6. Forecasts of Observed and Future RDI-12 Values
In Figure S18, the 12-month RDI—a key indicator for long-term rainfall deficits—plays a critical role in assessing agricultural drought, declining water resources, and hydrologic impacts. In the observed map (a), severe drought dominates much of the south, west, and most islands, whereas the northern sector and Crete appear wetter. This pattern indicates a persistent precipitation shortfall concentrated along the central belt.
Model-based projections:
•	LSTM (b): Reproduces the overall pattern well—capturing intense drought over the central and western regions and representing northern wetness—but projects very large increases in drought severity.
•	RF (c): Nearly inverts the current spread, predicting drought in the north and on Crete and a moist central band, contrary to observations.
•	GBM (d): Delivers a balanced performance, reflecting both dry and wet areas in line with reality, though with a somewhat damped intensity.
•	SVR (e): Forecasts marked intensification and expansion of drought along a northwest–southwest corridor, while wet conditions persist in the north.
•	XG (f): Produces a spatial layout similar to RF, with partial increases in drought severity.
